# Predicting Types of vegetables based on Images

## Abstract

There is a significant demand to eat healthier but many peopledon't have the background in types of produce to ensure they are always using the correct ingredients. With this project, we aim to create a tool that can identify what a given vegtable is usingmachine learning techniques.

## Introduction

As people who would like to eat an adequate amount of vegetables, and as avid farmer's market enjoyers, we often found ourselves overwhelmed with the many different types of vegetables out there. Using an image dataset found on kaggle.com with 15 different types of vegetables, this is a well-suited situation for a neural network. Since this issuch a large dataset, we know that training a neural network from scratch would take a significant amount of time, 

## Setup

a. The dataset used was conveniently already split up into a train, test, and validation set, with a folder for each vegetable - a total of 15. Each folder in the training set contained x images and each folder in the test and validation sets contained y images. 

## Results
